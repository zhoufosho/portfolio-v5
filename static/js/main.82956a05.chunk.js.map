Instead of reusing what exists, \n                  it is easier to create new ones – this created an explosion of content\n                  types that made it difficult for users to understand for us to maintain.\n                  <br /><br />\n                  In this project, I focused on creating a composer that <Strong>simplifies existing content types </Strong>\n                  and <Strong>enables lightweight content creation</Strong>. \n\n                  <br /><br />\n                  <Strong>Impact</Strong>: We are finishing development and are aiming to ship an experiment with this composer \n                  by the end of the quarter, with the goal of increasing content added in Spaces. \n                </Paragraph>\n              }\n              mainWidth={0.75}\n              secondary={\n                <Text variant=\"subtext\">\n                  I led and executed product design on the composer (vision, UI design, aligning) for \n                  the first half of 2020. \n                  <br /><br />\n                  I worked with 1 product engineer, 1 front-end engineer, and 1 iOS engineer.

Currently, adding an image requires 3 clicks \n              and every post requires both a title and a body. \n              In this vein, lightweight means making it easier to add short posts and image-based content.\n              <br /><br />\n              However, it is not clear how to add images and short posts. \n              What was the existing state of content types? \n              <ol>\n                <li><Strong>Confusing content types</Strong>\n                  <br />\n                  Each content type has its own rules and they are not mutually exclusive. For example, you can add a link to a post\n                  or add a link by itself. They have different rules, render differently, and it was not clear to users when to use each type. \n                </li>\n                <li><Strong>Too many types constantly slowed us down</Strong>\n                  <br />\n                    At the start of this project, there were four distinct content types. \n                    Whenever we wanted to change or add something,\n                    we had to design it, build it, and figure out ML models four times.\n                </li>\n                <li><Strong>Bias towards formal, long-form content</Strong>\n                  <br />\n                  Quora's emphasis has always been on long-form content, questions, and answers. However, with higher context of people\n                  contributing within Spaces – we should allow shorter, easier to produce content to thrive. \n                  Asking and answering questions on Quora is already relatively intimidating – \n                  now there is added complexity with users needing to understand the difference between a question, a post, \n                  a link, a share, and an answer, and the rules for each of them.\n                </li>\n              </ol>\n            </Paragraph>\n          </RegularWidth>\n          <Box>\n            <Image src=\"/images/composer-state.png\" />\n            <Footer>\n              Above: How to add three of the five possible content types from the composer. <br />\n              Each varies in visual style and mechanics, and each is owned by different teams.\n            </Footer>\n          </Box>\n        </Container>\n      </Section>\n\n      <Section>\n        <Container>\n          <RegularWidth>\n            <Heading3>\n              The Solution: Reducing to Posts & Questions\n            </Heading3>\n            <Box>\n              <Paragraph>\n                I oriented my solution towards: \n                <ul>\n                  <li><Strong>Fewer, more flexible content types</Strong>: consolidating posts and links</li>\n                  <li><Strong>Reducing requirements</Strong>: required fields, character limits </li>\n                  <li><Strong>Reducing friction</Strong>: removing clicks to start creating, removing clicks to create what you want</li>\n                </ul>\n                <br />\n                We are on-track to run an A/B test with the new composer.

I worked with \n              user research to get some insight into (1) what indicates a question and (2) \n              why people would prefer using a question versus a post and vice versa. \n              The main insight was that asking questions made it feel like you were more likely \n              to get a response, or receive answers. \n              <br /><br />\n              In order to help users bail out of adding a post and help them ask a question instead I designed this case to more \n              easily transform your post into a question.

On desktop and mobile web (not pictured), \n              we show the formatting options by default! When creating shorter content, having these formatting options \n              may distract from writing or nudge people towards creating longer content that is necessary. \n              <br /><br />\n              In my solution, I combined all formatting into one menu and behind a click, so the focus is on the \n              content itself.\n              <br />\n            </Paragraph>\n          </RegularWidth>\n          <Box>\n            <Flex>\n              <Box mr=\"small\"><Image src=\"/images/original-toolbar.png\" /></Box>\n              <Box><Image src=\"/images/composer-toolbar.png\" /></Box>\n            </Flex>\n            <Footer>\n              Left: original editor toolbar with two different formatting menus<br />\n              Right: solution to combine all formatting into one menu\n            </Footer>\n          </Box>\n          <RegularWidth>\n            <MainAndSecondaryGrid mt=\"huge\"\n              main={\n                <>\n                  <Subheading>\n                    Default to adding posts without titles\n                  </Subheading>\n                  <Paragraph>\n                    Having a title makes content feel more formal and that friction may reduce content added. \n                    However, we don't want to remove titles in the product. For example, there are \n                    Spaces that are effectively used as blogs, for which it is important to allow adding a title. \n                    <br /><br />\n                    Here, I tried de-emphasizing the importance of titles, but still providing a way to add titles \n                    when needed.\n                  </Paragraph>\n                </>\n              }\n              mainWidth={0.7}\n              secondary={\n                <Box>\n                  <Image src=\"/images/title-adding.png\" />\n                </Box>\n              }\n            />\n          </RegularWidth>\n          <RegularWidth mt=\"huge\">\n            <Subheading>\n              Clipboard detection for links\n            </Subheading>\n            <Paragraph>\n              In the past, users had to click on Link in order to add a link. Because we are explicitly changing \n              the way that Post and Link work, users may not immediately understand that you can add a link to a post. \n              Instead, the reaction might be closer to \"why can't I add links anymore\"? \n              <br /><br />\n              To mitigate this, I designed a flow that detects if you have a copied link on your clipboard. If so, we can \n              infer that you may want to share it, and thus preview the link in the composer. \n            </Paragraph>\n            <Box width=\"70%\" mx=\"auto\"><Image src=\"/images/clipboard-detect.png\" /></Box>\n            <Footer mt=\"tiny\">\n              Above: If the composer detects a link on your clipboard, it shows a preview of it\n            </Footer>\n          </RegularWidth>\n          <RegularWidth mt=\"huge\">\n            <Subheading>\n              Easier image handling\n            </Subheading>\n            <Paragraph>\n              As part of improving the ability to add images, I also updated the interaction to remove images. \n              Previously, it took 3 clicks after opening the composer to add an image – crazily enough, we saw an increase \n              in spaces content that was purely image-based! Despite this friction, there was demand for easier image adding. \n              The old editor also used desktop-based metaphors like selecting and hitting delete to remove an image. \n              <br /><br />\n              In my solution, I used a close button and added an image gallery to support add images with one-click.\n            </Paragraph>\n          </RegularWidth>\n          <Box>\n            <Flex>\n              <Box mr=\"medium\"><Image src=\"/images/old-image-adding.png\" /></Box>\n              <Box><Image src=\"/images/image-adding.png\" /></Box>\n            </Flex>\n            <Footer mt=\"tiny\">\n              Left: Adding an image with 3 clicks after opening, hitting delete to remove an image <br />\n              Right: Adding an image with 1 click, using mobile-friendly buttons to remove images\n            </Footer>\n          </Box>\n          <RegularWidth mt=\"huge\">\n            <Subheading>\n              PROTOTYPE: PROCEED WITH CAUTION\n            </Subheading>\n            <Paragraph>\n              Because designers at Quora are usually responsible for writing front-end code, the prototypes we make are \n              directly in the codebase.

In this project, we added and expanded on: \n                <ul>\n                  <li><Strong>Admins</Strong> - can invite and remove all other roles, \n                  change settings, delete the Space, and everything else moderators can do\n                  </li>\n                  <li><Strong>Moderators</Strong> – can invite and remove contributors and followers, can block \n                  people from the space, manage submissions, and remove content from the Space</li>\n                  <li><Strong>Contributors</Strong> - can post without permission</li>\n                </ul>\n              </Paragraph>           \n            </Box>\n            <Box>\n              <Flex>\n                <Box><Image src=\"/images/cred-and-badges.png\" /></Box>\n                <Box><Image src=\"/images/admin-log.png\" /></Box>\n              </Flex>\n              <Footer>\n                Left: Badges make admins and moderators more easily recognizable and increases their perceived reputation<br />\n                Right: All actions taken in the Space are recorded in the admin log to increase accountability and awareness \n                amongst various people managing the Space\n              </Footer>\n            </Box>\n          </RegularWidth>\n        </Container>\n      </Section>\n\n      <Section>\n        <Container>\n          <RegularWidth>\n            <Heading3>\n              Leveraging Posts: Moving beyond Q&A\n            </Heading3>\n            <Box>\n              <Paragraph>\n                One learning I took away from the early prototypes was that Quora questions are extremely extremely complicated. \n                More importantly – from a user perspective, questions and answers may be too restrictive in the types of content you can create. For example, \n                users may need time to discuss, debate, and figure out what their norms and practices are, and it feels too awkward and formal to ask a question like \n                \"What are our norms?\". \n                <br /><br />\n                In our first build of Spaces, I proposed our team to focus exclusively on freeform posts and to ignore questions entirely. \n                The team had already built out some version of question integration, but I pushed to remove all question features and restart from scratch.  \n                This allowed us to focus our time developing <StyledLink href=\"#roles\">roles</StyledLink>, building out invite mechanics, \n                and exploring models for <StyledLink href=\"#notifs\">notifications & feed</StyledLink>.\n                Before launch, we followed up on integrating questions and links; \n                however, starting with posts made a lot of the initial assumptions much easier. \n                (Spoiler: In 2020, I consolidated links and posts while working on the <StyledLink href=\"/composer\">composer</StyledLink>)\n                <br /><br />\n                <Strong>Impact</Strong>: Before we started investing in other content types in 2019,\n                posts and links respectively made up <Strong>60%</Strong> and <Strong>12%</Strong> of content added to Spaces. <br /><br />\n              </Paragraph>\n            </Box>\n          </RegularWidth>\n          <Box>\n            <Box><Image src=\"/images/content-types.png\" /></Box>\n            <Footer>\n              Above: Non-Spaces Quora allows content in the form of Q&A and links.

This problem became harder\n                  as our content scaled. \n                  <br /><br />\n                  However, since Spaces allow users to define content boundaries, the likelihood of something\n                  being more relevant is much higher. The speed of content through the system \n                  flows much faster, so we have to shift our mode of interaction from email -> to feed and notifications.\n                  <br /><br />\n                  In 2019, I led a project with 1 engineer and 1 data scientist to run an experiment introducing a content sorting to \n                  enable larger spaces to surface the best content to the top. My main role was aligning stakeholders on what the \n                  heuristics should be used in the sort. In 2019, I also designed and implemented an experiment \n                  to test an optimized notification landing experience.  \n                  <br /><br />\n                  <Strong>Impact</Strong>: The notification experiment increased active minutes on the Space page by ~90%. \n                  Sorting the space page increased space content added by ~25%.\n              </Paragraph>\n            </Box>\n          </RegularWidth>\n          <Box mt=\"large\">\n            <Flex alignSelf=\"center\">\n              <Box><Image src=\"/images/notif-picker.png\" /></Box>\n              <Box><Image src=\"/images/feed-sort.png\" /></Box>\n            </Flex>\n            <Footer>\n              Left: By default, users receive highlight notifs trained by machine learning models.

With submissions, anyone can submit content to the space. \n                  Once the submission is approved, this content appears in the space and is eligible to be sent \n                  in notifications. \n                  <br /><br />\n                  By launching of Submissions, our goals were: \n                  <ul>\n                    <li>Increase content added to Spaces </li>\n                    <li>Enable more people to contribute to Spaces </li>\n                    <li>Long term, increase number of regular contributors to Spaces </li>\n                    <li>Enable moderators and admins to find more engaged and qualified contributors </li>\n                  </ul>\n                  <br />\n                  <Strong>Impact</Strong>: ~25% of spaces content today comes from Submissions\n                </Paragraph>\n              }\n              mainWidth={0.65}\n              secondary={\n                <Box alignSelf=\"center\">\n                  <Box><Image src=\"/images/submissions.png\" /></Box>\n                  <Footer>\n                    Above: admin/moderator view for handling submissioins\n                  </Footer>\n                </Box>\n              }\n            />\n          </RegularWidth>\n        </Container>\n      </Section>\n\n      <Section>\n        <Container>\n          <RegularWidth>\n            <Heading3> \n              Suggestions: Augmenting with Content from Other Sources\n            </Heading3>\n            <Box>\n              <Paragraph>\n                One of the biggest painpoints we heard over and over was that it was difficult to \n                find quality content. We started asking: how might we \n                <Strong> help source content </Strong>for Spaces?\n                <br /><br />\n                In early 2019, we had a unique opportunity working with many digital publishers. Some were looking to  \n                increase their clicks and views in an easy, set-it-and-forget-it way, whereas \n                others wanted to take this as an opportunity to try building their audience on Quora. \n                Using RSS feeds as a generalizable framework that publishers are familiar with, \n                we wanted to build integrations to support both types of clients. \n\n                <br /><br />\n                For RSS links on Spaces, I led the product vision, did IC design work, and wrote front-end code to \n                launch RSS link suggestions. I worked with 1 engineer and 2 members from our writer-relations \n                team to launch Spaces with publishing partners in the US and India, almost all of which \n                are still on Quora today.\n                <br /><br />\n                <Strong>Impact</Strong>: Two months after launch, ~43% of spaces content came from \n                publisher spaces.\n\n                <br /><br />\n              </Paragraph>\n              <Box>\n                <Box><Image src=\"/images/rss-publisher-spaces.png\" /></Box>\n                <Footer>\n                  Left: With answer suggestions, users can find existing content on Quora to share to their space<br />\n                  Right: With link suggestions, users can connect RSS feeds to their space and share links\n                </Footer>\n              </Box>\n              <Paragraph>\n                <br /><br />\n                An ongoing challenge for Spaces was: how might we <Strong>help contributors find content \n                to add to Spaces</Strong> without having to hunt across the internet? \n                <br /><br />\n                In mid/late 2019, we decided to leverage the giant repository of answers on Quora, \n                and provide our users with a list of suggested answers to share. To implement this quickly, \n                we realized the RSS feature could be expanded to include answer sharing. \n                I guided product direction using the framework and principles I had previously established \n                to help the team of 1 PM and 1 engineer launch answer suggestions.\n                <br /><br />\n                Our goals with Suggestions were:\n                <ul>\n                  <li>Reduce friction of sharing content from on- and off-Quora by integrating it into the product</li>\n                  <li>Increase ease of curation by suggesting answers that our machine learning models think are share-worthy </li>\n                </ul>\n                <Strong>Impact</Strong>: ~19% of spaces content today comes from Suggestions\n                <br /><br />\n              </Paragraph>\n            </Box>\n          </RegularWidth>\n          <Box>\n            <Flex alignSelf=\"center\">\n              <Box><Image src=\"/images/suggestions-answer.png\" /></Box>\n              <Box><Image src=\"/images/suggestions-link.png\" /></Box>\n            </Flex>\n            <Footer>\n              Left: With answer suggestions, users can find existing content on Quora to share to their space<br />\n              Right: With link suggestions, users can connect RSS feeds to their space and share links\n            </Footer>\n          </Box>\n        </Container>\n      </Section>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Spaces;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { Box, Button, Text, Flex, Image } from \"rebass\";\nimport { Heading1, Subheading, Heading2, Heading3, Paragraph, Container, Section, Strong, Footer, SiteHeader } from \"./Components\";\n\nfunction Dogfooding() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <SiteHeader />\n      <Section>\n        <Container>\n          <Box mt=\"40vh\">\n            <Heading2>\n              Dogfooding\n            </Heading2>\n            <Box width={[\"80%\", \"70%\"]}>\n              <Paragraph>\n                Coming Soon\n              </Paragraph>\n            </Box>\n          </Box>\n        </Container>\n      </Section>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Dogfooding;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport Home from \"./Home\";\nimport Composer from \"./Composer\";\nimport Spaces from \"./Spaces\";\nimport Dogfooding from \"./Dogfooding\";\nimport { PrivatePage } from \"./Components\";\nimport {\n  BrowserRouter as Router,\n  Link,\n  Route,\n  Switch,\n  } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nexport const PRIVATE_PAGE_KEY = process.env.REACT_APP_PRIVATE_PAGE_KEY\n\nconst HomePage = () => <Home />;\nconst ComposerPage = () => <PrivatePage component={Composer} />;\nconst SpacesPage = () => <PrivatePage component={Spaces} />;\n\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Router>\n      <div>\n        <Switch>\n          <Route exact path=\"/\" component={HomePage} />\n          <Route path=\"/composer\" component={ComposerPage} />\n          <Route path=\"/spaces\" component={SpacesPage} />\n          <Route render={() => <h1>Page not found</h1>} />\n        </Switch>\n      </div>\n    </Router>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
