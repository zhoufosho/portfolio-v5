                As Quora as scaled, it became more difficult to ask questions 
                and get satisfactory answers. We believed this was due to 
                context collapse – lack of predictable audience expectations. 
                <br /><br />
                In early 2018, I focused on researching the problem and prototyping
                various product explorations that creates boundaries
                in order  to support more contextual interactions. Once we felt 
                confident in a product direction, we <Strong>launched a communities product </Strong>
                in late 2018. Since then, our team has been focusing on
                <Strong> scaling content generation</Strong>. 
                <br /><br />
                Since this project has spanned multiple teams and quarters, below I will highlight 
                some of the key projects and product areas that I was most heavily involved in.

                Quora promises the "best answer to any question". As the 
                product has scaled to 300M+ monthly active uniques across 
                hundreds of countries and dozens of languages, it has become harder to 
                understand the subtext and expectations behind a question. <br /><br />

                How might we <Strong>prevent context collapse</Strong> to more effectively share knowledge?<br /><br />

                and a groups product with no questions, only posts, we determined the best way forward was to create
                a product where users decide where the boundaries were.

              Notifications & Feed: Emphasizing Real-Time Content
            </Heading3>
            <Box>
              <Paragraph>
                  Prior to Spaces, Quora users rarely received any notifications – 
                  most engagement came in the form of receiving and reading Digest emails.   
                  Outside of Spaces, only 6% of users receive on average more than one notif per week.
                  With Digest emails, we had to rank massive sets of answers related to topics that users 
                  were interested in to find a few that were relevant. This problem became harder
                  as our content scaled. 
                  <br /><br />
                  However, since Spaces allow users to define content boundaries, the likelihood of something
                  being more relevant is much higher. The speed of content through the system 
                  flows much faster, so we have to shift our mode of interaction from email -> to feed and notifications.
