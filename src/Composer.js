                  Quora's mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge. For nearly the first 
                  decade on the platform, all of the knowledge existed in the form of questions 
                  and answers. 
                  <br /><br />
                  With the launch of <StyledLink href="/spaces">Spaces</StyledLink> and a new engagement strategy, it was becoming evident that 
                  our historical focus on Q&A and long-form content was limiting our growth. 
                  At Quora, content types are very difficult to change because of all the ranking 
                  and engineering infrastructure that are built into them. Instead of reusing what exists, 
                  it is easier to create new ones – this created an explosion of content
                  types that made it difficult for users to understand for us to maintain.
                  <br /><br />
                  In this project, I focused on creating a composer that <Strong>simplifies existing content types </Strong>
                  and <Strong>enables lightweight content creation</Strong>. 

                  <br /><br />
                  <Strong>Impact</Strong>: We are finishing development and are aiming to ship an experiment with this composer 
                  by the end of the quarter, with the goal of increasing content added in Spaces.

                  I led and executed product design on the composer (vision, UI design, aligning) for

                  <br /><br />
                  I worked with 1 product engineer, 1 front-end engineer, and 1 iOS engineer. I also 
                  worked with user research to understand people's mental model of content types. <br /><br />
                  Here, I was responsible for coming up with the vision of the composer, facilitating 
                  cross-functional coordination to build a React prototype, presenting the vision to 
                  the executive team, and managing cross-functional coordination to (soon!) release 
                  the experience on iOS.

              Why a new composer? 
            </Heading3>
            <Paragraph>
              The original motivation for working on the composer was to make content creation more lightweight. 
              What does it mean to be lightweight? Currently, adding an image requires 3 clicks 
              and every post requires both a title and a body. 
              In this vein, lightweight means making it easier to add short posts and image-based content.
              <br /><br />
              However, it is not clear how to add images and short posts. 
              What was the existing state of content types? 
              <ol>
                <li><Strong>Confusing content types</Strong>
                  <br />
                  Each content type has its own rules and they are not mutually exclusive. For example, you can add a link to a post
                  or add a link by itself. They have different rules, render differently, and it was not clear to users when to use each type. 
                </li>
                <li><Strong>Too many types constantly slowed us down</Strong>
                  <br />
                    At the start of this project, there were four distinct content types. 
                    Whenever we wanted to change or add something,
                    we had to design it, build it, and figure out ML models four times.
                </li>
                <li><Strong>Bias towards formal, long-form content</Strong>
                  <br />
                  Quora's emphasis has always been on long-form content, questions, and answers. However, with higher context of people
                  contributing within Spaces – we should allow shorter, easier to produce content to thrive. 
                  Asking and answering questions on Quora is already relatively intimidating – 
                  now there is added complexity with users needing to understand the difference between a question, a post, 
                  a link, a share, and an answer, and the rules for each of them.

            <Paragraph>
              Previously, because you could add links to posts, it was very confusing to 
              users when to compose the Link type versus the Post type. There are some 
              engineering constraints where we still want to keep the technical infrastructure for 
              links. <br /><br />
              I designed the link adding experience of Posts to be similar to that of Links, essentially 
              keeping them to be one unified experience in the front-end, even if the backend is different.

              Enabling switching between questions and posts
            </Subheading>
            <Paragraph>
              This solution defaults users into posting and as a result, buries questions. I worked with 
              user research to get some insight into (1) what indicates a question and (2) 
              why people would prefer using a question versus a post and vice versa. 
              The main insight was that asking questions made it feel like you were more likely 
              to get a response, or receive answers. 
              <br /><br />
              In order to help users bail out of adding a post and help them ask a question instead I designed this case to more 
              easily transform your post into a question. We think this will also help mitigate a potential loss of questions asked in Spaces.

              De-emphasizing formatting
            </Subheading>
            <Paragraph>
              Because Quora centered on long-form content, there was often a need to add formatting 
              in order to break up text into more legible chunks. On desktop and mobile web (not pictured), 
              we show the formatting options by default! When creating shorter content, having these formatting options 
              may distract from writing or nudge people towards creating longer content that is necessary. 
              <br /><br />
              In my solution, I combined all formatting into one menu and behind a click, so the focus is on the 
              content itself.

                  </Subheading>
                  <Paragraph>
                    Having a title makes content feel more formal and that friction may reduce content added. 
                    However, we don't want to remove titles in the product. For example, there are 
                    Spaces that are effectively used as blogs, for which it is important to allow adding a title. 
                    <br /><br />
                    Here, I tried de-emphasizing the importance of titles, but still providing a way to add titles 
                    when needed.

              Clipboard detection for links
            </Subheading>
            <Paragraph>
              In the past, users had to click on Link in order to add a link. Because we are explicitly changing 
              the way that Post and Link work, users may not immediately understand that you can add a link to a post. 
              Instead, the reaction might be closer to "why can't I add links anymore"? 
              <br /><br />
              To mitigate this, I designed a flow that detects if you have a copied link on your clipboard. If so, we can 
              infer that you may want to share it, and thus preview the link in the composer.

            <Paragraph>
              As part of improving the ability to add images, I also updated the interaction to remove images. 
              Previously, it took 3 clicks after opening the composer to add an image – crazily enough, we saw an increase 
              in spaces content that was purely image-based! Despite this friction, there was demand for easier image adding. 
              The old editor also used desktop-based metaphors like selecting and hitting delete to remove an image. 
              <br /><br />
              In my solution, I used a close button and added an image gallery to support add images with one-click.

              PROTOTYPE: PROCEED WITH CAUTION

            <Paragraph>
              Because designers at Quora are usually responsible for writing front-end code, the prototypes we make are 
              directly in the codebase. However, this was a unique case where the project required native staffing and coordination, 
              and our front-end engineer had deep technical knowledge on our text editor. <br /><br />

              In order to build alignment across teams and stakeholders, I built a "source of truth" interactive Figma prototype to 
              surface edge cases and to show various details. It may have deteriorated since, but feel free to try and play 
              around with it!
